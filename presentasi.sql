It is only by the desperate sacrifice of Edwards right arm that he is able to affix Alphonses soul to a suit of armor. Devastated and alone, it is the hope that they would both eventually return to their original bodies that gives Edward the inspiration to obtain metal limbs called \'automail\' and become a state alchemist, the Fullmetal Alchemist.\n\nThree years of searching later, the brothers seek the Philosophers Stone, a mythical relic that allows an alchemist to overcome the Law of Equivalent Exchange. Even with military allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on their side, the brothers find themselves caught up in a nationwide conspiracy that leads them not only to the true nature of the elusive Philosophers Stone, but their countrys murky history as well. In between finding a serial killer and racing against time, Edward and Alphonse must ask themselves if what they are doing will make them human again... or take away their humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]', 'https://myanimelist.cdn-dena.com/images/anime/5/47421.jpg', 'Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood', '鋼の錬金術師 FULLMETAL ALCHEMIST', 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/1IIgtdFWvBI?enablejsapi=1&wmode=opaque&autoplay=1', 'Finished Airing', 'Apr 5, 2009 to Jul 4, 2010', 64, 'TV', '24 min. per ep.', 'R - 17+ (violence & profanity)', 9.25),
